# Introduction

## Why R?

R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It can usually be used for the entire process of a statistical analysis: reading in data, cleaning data, analyzing data, and visualization.

-   R is free
-   Can do virtually anything
-   Lots of community support (packages, help online, etc.)
-   Easy to replicate results

## Reading in Data

The function we use to read in data will depend on what format the data is in. This lab will use a .csv file as the example, and the relevant function to read in a .csv file is the `read.csv()` function.

Let's load in the data. We will store the output of the `read.csv()` function in an object. You can name the object whatever you wish, but make it informative.

```{r read_data}
nhanes <- read.csv("nhanes.csv", 
                   stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```
